# Documentation:
* I can use np.random.rand(rows, columns) to create random numbers in an array
* In Python, you can reshape a list into an array by using .reshape(rows, columns)
* In Problem 2, you can call the array and square each element by using .square(variable where the array is stored)
* By using modulo (%), the program will look for the numbers that have a remainder of 0 and then print it in an array
* \n makes a new line making the output more organized
